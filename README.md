# Move On Up

A modern, smart Chrome extension to "move up" one level in the current tab's URL, with advanced navigation modes, customizable user experience, and a clean, accessible options interface.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Smart URL Navigation**  
  Move up one level in the URL with a single click or keyboard shortcut, with multiple navigation modes:
  - **Standard**: Remove all query parameters and hash, then remove the last path segment (`/foo/bar?x=1#top` → `/foo`).
  - **Slash-keep**: Remove only the last path segment, keep query and hash.
  - **Root**: Go directly to the site root (`/`), no params or hash.
  - **Param**: Remove one query parameter at a time (right to left), then hash, then last path segment.

- **Options Page**  
  - Modern, responsive UI (vanilla HTML/CSS/JS).
  - Select navigation mode (radio buttons).
  - Enable/disable notifications (toast after redirect).
  - Enable/disable context menu (right-click).
  - Keyboard shortcut info and customization guidance.
  - Instant effect: all options update extension behavior in real time.

- **Context Menu**  
  - Right-click for quick actions:
    - "Move up one level" (current mode)
    - "Go to root"
  - Menu visibility is user-configurable.

- **Notifications**  
  - Optional Chrome notification after redirection, showing the new URL.

- **Keyboard Shortcut**  
  - Default: `Ctrl+Shift+ArrowUp` (Windows/Linux), `Cmd+Shift+ArrowUp` (Mac).
  - Shortcut is customizable in Chrome extension settings.

- **No Popup**  
  - Clicking the extension icon immediately performs the action (no popup UI).
